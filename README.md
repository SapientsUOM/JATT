# JATT
Java Virtual Machine Auto Tuning Tool
JATT (Java Virtual Machine Auto Tuning Tool) is an open source software tool which was developed to optimize the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JATT is developed based on the OpenTuner, another open source software framework to build domain specific auto tuners. JATT is specifically designed to tune HotSpot JVM, one of the most commonly used JVM. Although JATT is primarily focused on HotSpot JVM, JATT source code can be easily extended to build an auto tuner specific to a different JVM implementation. JATT can be used in both Console mode and the Graphical User Interface mode(GUI) mode. But if you are using JATT for more advanced work (i.e. research, tuning advance java programs) we highly recommend you to use JATT in the console mode.
